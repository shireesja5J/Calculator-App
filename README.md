# Calculator-App


This is a **calculator project** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **Java**, and **Python**. The project includes a simple arithmetic calculator implemented in different technologies, showcasing the versatility of each language and framework.

## Features
- **HTML & CSS**: A basic web-based calculator with a user-friendly interface, styled with CSS.
- **Java**: A calculator with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java's Swing framework.
- **Python**: A command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations.

## File Structure

The repository contains three different implementations of the calculator:

- **`html-css/`**: 
  - `index.html`: The main HTML file for the web-based calculator.
  - `style.css`: The styling file that controls the look and feel of the web page.

- **`java/`**: 
  - `Calculator.java`: The Java file that implements the calculator with a graphical user interface using Swing.

- **`python/`**: 
  - `calculator.py`: A Python script that provides a simple command-line interface for performing basic calculations.

## How to Run

### 1. HTML/CSS Implementation
To run the HTML and CSS version of the calculator:
1. Simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
2. You will see the calculator interface, and you can start performing basic arithmetic operations.

### 2. Java Implementation
To run the Java-based calculator with a GUI:
1. Ensure you have **Java** installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the `java/` folder.
3. Compile the `Calculator.java` file:
   ```bash
   javac Calculator.java

    Python Implementation
   
To run the Python-based command-line calculator:

Ensure you have Python installed.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the python/ folder.python calculator.py

Technologies Used
HTML5: For creating the structure of the web-based calculator.
CSS3: For styling the calculator and making the UI visually appealing.
Java (Swing): For creating a graphical user interface (GUI) for the calculator.
Python: For creating a command-line-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations.

### Tips for Writing a Good GitHub Project Explanation:
- **Be clear and concise**: Avoid unnecessary jargon. The goal is to make it easy for anyone to understand what the project does and how to use it.
- **Include installation instructions**: If your project requires setting up an environment (e.g., installing Python or Java), provide clear steps.
- **List dependencies**: If the project uses any external libraries or frameworks (e.g., for the Java GUI), list them in the README.
- **Include a License**: If you want others to contribute or use your code, include a license (MIT is a common choice).
- **Add visual aids (optional)**: If applicable, include screenshots of your calculator interfaces or a demo GIF.

Once you've written your explanation, you can include this as the **`README.md`** in the root directory of your GitHub repository.

### Pushing to GitHub:
After creating the `README.md`, follow the steps I provided earlier to **push** your project to GitHub. Make sure the `README.md` is included in the commit:
